**Niche** - Early Founders + Deep Tech

**Vision** - Solve problems with high velocity (speed and direction), considering that we will get a single shot

Consultancy for me is to be in the trenches and get the work done. Consultants should have experiences and knowledge required to lead towards the success of a goal.

Experience comes from dealing with the same or similar problem statements. Experience is doing, putting in the work to solve the problem - mentally and physically. The mental component is nuanced in terms of **how a problem is seen, how a solution is explored, how an impact is defined, how a plan is sketched, and how people are rallied to its cause.**
